Visualization of the Hopf fibration - a nontrivial fibration of a three-dimensional sphere $S^3$ in algebraic topology and differential geometry. **You can read more in the file "info_about_fibration.pdf"**. 
It presents the entire mathematical essence of the problem in Russian laungage.

Hopf Fibration: Visualizing the 3-SphereThis project provides a topological and geometric exploration of the Hopf Fibration, a way to represent the 3D sphere ($S^3$) as a collection of interlocking circles organized over a 2D sphere ($S^2$)

The 3D sphere is an object existing in 4D space, making it impossible to visualize directly2. This project breaks down the structure of such objects using the concept of Fiber Bundles (foliation), moving from simple examples to the complex Hopf Fibration.

Key Concepts Covered:

Fibration of a Ball: Explaining 3D objects to a "flat friend" by showing 2D circular cross-sections over time

Hopf Fibration: Representation of $S^3$ using complex numbers: $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1$.

Mapping circles in $S^3$ to points on the Riemann sphere ($S^2$) via the Hopf map: $h(z_1, z_2) = z_1 / z_2$

Visualizing the result as nested tori composed of Villarceau circles.
