Hopf Fibration: Visualizing the 3-SphereThis project provides a topological and geometric exploration of the Hopf Fibration, a way to represent the 3D sphere ($S^3$) as a collection of interlocking circles organized over a 2D sphere ($S^2$)1.📑 Project OverviewThe 3D sphere is an object existing in 4D space, making it impossible to visualize directly2. This project breaks down the structure of such objects using the concept of Fiber Bundles (foliation), moving from simple examples to the complex Hopf Fibration.Key Concepts Covered:Fibration of a Ball: Explaining 3D objects to a "flat friend" by showing 2D circular cross-sections over time3.Möbius Strip Fibration: Demonstrating how a Möbius strip can be decomposed into a family of interlocking circles4444.+1Hopf Fibration: * Representation of $S^3$ using complex numbers: $|z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1$5.Mapping circles in $S^3$ to points on the Riemann sphere ($S^2$) via the Hopf map: $h(z_1, z_2) = z_1 / z_2$666.+1Visualizing the result as nested tori composed of Villarceau circles777.
